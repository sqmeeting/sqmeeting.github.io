# SQMeeting Server Basic Configuration

This page explains how to configure SQMeeting Server after installation to provide basic meeting services.

To configure the following functions, you need to log in to the SQMeeting Server web management page:

Login address: https://server-IP:7443, e.g.: https://10.150.1.202:7443

Default admin user: admin    
Password: Admin123!@#  (Please change the password after login)

## I. System Settings

After logging into the web management page, navigate to System Management -> System Settings to configure the network and ports required by the system.

- If your system only works on the intranet, you can keep the default settings. You can also configure the intranet domain name and management port (default: 7443) as needed; in the System Settings → Node List → Modify page, configure the media ports (default: 32500-32507).

- If you deploy the SQMeeting Server in an enterprise DMZ or cloud platform and need to access SQMeeting Server's login, scheduling, and meeting services from the public network, you need to configure the following:

- ✅Preparation: Public IP, domain name (optional).

- ✅Configure firewall: Map the public IP (e.g., 36.105.101.82) to the internal IP of SQMeeting Server (e.g., 10.150.1.202) on the DMZ or cloud platform firewall, and open the management port and media port group configured in your system (e.g., open tcp: 7443, udp: 32500 - 32507).

- ✅Configure public network: Navigate to SQMeeting Server management page → System Management → System Settings, configure the public management IP (icon 1), management port, public media IP (icon 2) and media ports, submit the changes, and the service will automatically restart for the changes to take effect.
